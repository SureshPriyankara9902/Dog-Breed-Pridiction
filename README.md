## Introduction

The Dog Breed predection App is a simple Streamlit application that uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the breed of a dog based on an uploaded image. Whether you're a dog enthusiast or just curious about your dog's breed,Model accuracy,visualization,feedback,image gallary this app can provide you with an answer.

## Features

- **Breed Prediction**: Upload a picture of your dog, and the app will predict the most likely breed from a list of 70 different breeds.
- **Easy to Use**: The user-friendly interface makes it simple for anyone to use.
- **Model Accuracy Display**:Show the accuracy of your prediction model on the interface. This could be displayed as a percentage, perhaps below the prediction result, indicating how confident the model is in its prediction.
- **Visualization**:Prediction Confidence Chart: Include a bar or pie chart to visualize the model's confidence levels across different breeds. This can give users a better understanding of how the model arrived at its prediction.
- **Feedback Mechanism**:Allow users to provide feedback on the prediction. For example, users can indicate whether the prediction was accurate or not, and this feedback can be used for future model improvements.
- **Image Gallery**:Create an image gallery where users can view previously uploaded images along with their predictions. This could be a fun feature to let users see what other breeds have been predicted by the app
